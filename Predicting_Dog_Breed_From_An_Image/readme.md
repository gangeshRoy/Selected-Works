## README

In this project I built used classical machine learning models to predict to predict a dog's breed out of 120 breeds, based on an image. The data were sourced from [Stanford's dog dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). I used Graphlab for image feature extraction (they were purchased by Apple shortly after I created this project so the code is no longer maintained) and scikit learn's support vector classifier for predictions. 

My post performant model was a support vector machine, which achieved 65.5% validation accuracy on this classification task.
