For this project, I experimented with several neural network architectures to classify images of clothing from the [Zalando Research dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist). This dataset contains 70,000 images depicting an article of clothing. 

The task is to classify these images into one of 10 categories: t-Shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag and ankle boot. 

My most performant model in this repo is a convolutional neural network, which achieves an 89.6% validation accuracy.
